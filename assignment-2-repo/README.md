Assignment 2 - HTML/CSS Multi-page Static Website with SVG Animation!


Project Overview:
This project is an HTML/CSS website with three main pages: index.html, two.html, and three.html. Each page features unique content and custom SVG elements, with an SVG-based favicon included for the entire site.

The file structure I used is as follows: 
assignment-2-repo/
├─ index.html
├─ style.css
├─ views/
│   ├─ two.html
│   ├─ three.html
├─ resources/
    ├─ favicon.svg
    ├─ page-three.svg
